                <h3>Egusi Soup</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Egusi is a West African name for the seeds of plants like squash, melons, and gourds that, when dried and ground become a staple ingredient in many West African dishes.  Particularly, in Nigerian culture, egusi is popular with pounded yam. These seeds are rich in fat and protein, and add these essential nutrients into West African Cuisine.</p>

            <p>Nigerian Egusi Soup is a soup thickened with ground melon seeds and contains leafy and other vegetables.  It is one of the most popular soups prepared by most tribes in Nigeria with considerable variation and often eaten with dishes like Pounded Yams.  Prepare it with goat, beef, fish, or shellfish!</p>
