        <h3>Cooked Oha Soup!</h3>
        <p>This is a delicious soup that is easy to make and you can guarantee that no matter how it is made, it would still come out delicious.</p>

        <p>This recipe comes from the eastern part of Nigeria. It is one of those native Igbo soups that you taste and just canâ€™t forget. If you ever visit me and I make Oha soup for you, best believe you are very important to me.
            Oha leaves are gotten from the evergreen tree in Africa. The plant is botanically known as Pterocarpus mildraedii. It contains many nutrients such as fibre, amino acids, calcium, iron, potassium and vitamin A</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Put meat, kponmo and stock fish in a pot, add seasoning and onions, let simmer for 5 minutes, then put a little water, cover and let cook till meat is tender.</li>
                <li>You can either add cocoyam while cooking the meat so it can cook together to save time or cook the cocoyam separately.</li>
                <li>When it has cooked properly, add 2 cups of water then add palm oil, allow to cook for about ten minutes. (Remove cocoyam and pound in a mortar or blend using a blender or a food processor)</li>
                <li>Add ground crayfish, ground pepper, salt and let cook for another seven minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the blended/ pounded cocoyam paste or achi (before you add achi to your soup, make sure you dissolve it in a little water, if not your soup will cake up). Let the soup cook for about three minutes</li>
                <li>Add your Oziza first (Oziza leaves are stronger than Oha leaves), then add your Oha leaves.</li>
                <li> Let it cook for one minute, then turn off the cooker</li>
            </ol>
